## Handwritten Digit Recognition

# Overview
This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. It uses the MNIST dataset, which is a collection of handwritten digits, to train and evaluate the model.

# MNIST Dataset
MNIST is a well-known dataset containing handwritten digits from 0 to 9, with each image being 28x28 pixels in size. The dataset includes 70,000 images, split into 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. The images are grayscale and centered, which simplifies preprocessing.

# Requirements
Python 3.5+
Scikit-Learn (latest version)
Numpy (+ mkl for Windows)
Matplotlib
Keras (with TensorFlow backend)

## Introduction
The MNIST dataset is a popular benchmark in the field of machine learning and deep learning. The dataset's simplicity allows for quick model prototyping and experimentation. Keras, a high-level neural network API, is used to build and train the model. Keras is known for its user-friendly, modular, and extensible design, and it supports deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow.

# Description
This project implements a 5-layer Sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for digit recognition. The CNN is trained on the MNIST dataset using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend. The model's architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers, which work together to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition.

# Model Architecture
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the input images.
Pooling Layers: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
Dense Layers: Perform classification based on the extracted features.
Training
The model is trained using the training set (60,000 images) with appropriate data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.

# Accuracy
The CNN model achieved an average accuracy of 92.1% and an R-squared value of 0.78 on the test set. The training process was conducted on a GPU to expedite the computation. If you don't have access to a GPU, the training time may be longer. You can reduce the number of epochs to decrease computation time if necessary.

# Results
Training Accuracy: 92.4%
Test Accuracy: 91.8%
R-squared Value: 0.78
These results demonstrate the model's capability to accurately recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
